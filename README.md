Collaborating on research for the International Barcode of Life BIOSCAN program for the university of Waterloo


Conducting research to enable a far more extensive and detailed understanding of global biodiversity and the interactions between species and ecosystems.
Collaboration on the BIOSCAN Program, part of the International Barcode of Life (iBOL) project.
Increased Machine Learning model accuracy using Confident Learning for error detection in data


Increased Machine Learning model accuracy using Confident Learning for error detection in data using CleanLab.
Testing on MNIST dataset. Detected 155 labels that are high risk as mislabeled.
Implemented on actual dataset and waiting to measure results.
