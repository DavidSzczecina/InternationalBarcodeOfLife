Collaborating on research for the International Barcode of Life BIOSCAN program


Conducting research to enable a far more extensive and detailed understanding of global biodiversity and the interactions between species and ecosystems
Collaboration on the BIOSCAN Program, part of the International Barcode of Life (iBOL) project

Working on 2 approaches:

Removing bad data from the training set:

Increased Machine Learning model accuracy using Confident Learning for error detection in data
Used CleanLab for this, testing on MNIST dataset. Detected 155 labels that are high risk as mislabeled 
Implemented on actual dataset and waiting to measure results.

Having the CNN identify and group similar taxas in the second last layer of neural network
Testing on MNIST dataset, using TSNE and UMAP to form groupings in data
